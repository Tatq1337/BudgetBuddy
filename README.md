# BudgetBuddy
My first ever app in Swift. Simple app where you can track your expenses, you can also set reminder for example discord sub expiration date. I also used free API to fetch data about discounted things on Amazon. Your expenses and reminder are stored in Database. You can easily delete records from the database by moving the item and then clicking the Delete button.
